# iGV-Data-Extractor
The "iGV Realizations Extraction" script facilitates data extraction and manipulation from the AIESEC GIS API for Global Volunteer (iGV) opportunities. It uses GraphQL queries to fetch application data based on specified criteria such as approval dates, realization statuses, and program types. The `dataExtraction_GV` function fetches data, while `dataManipulation_GV` processes and formats it into rows for updating a designated spreadsheet. It handles various opportunity statuses, retrieves organization details, and integrates standard options. Additionally, functions like `updateECBChecks_GV` and `updateBreaks_GV` handle specific updates and status checks within the spreadsheet, enhancing data accuracy and completeness for monitoring iGV operations effectively.
